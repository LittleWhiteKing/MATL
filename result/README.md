Here is the results module, which contains the MATL model's 50-fold crossover results, ablation experiment results, and comparison experiment results. At the same time, it also contains the result diagram of the model, data distribution diagram and so on. For the rest of the information, please refer to the specific content in the folder. Thank you for checking my research in your busy schedule. I wish you a successful work, good health and all the best.
